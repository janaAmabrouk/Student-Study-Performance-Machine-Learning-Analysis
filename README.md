# 🎓 What Makes a Student Successful? (Data Analysis Project)

This project explores a simple but important question: **Why do some students perform better than others?** We looked at 1,000 students to see how factors like family background, nutrition, and study habits impact their grades in Math, Reading, and Writing.

## 🌟 Top 3 Takeaways
1. **Nutrition Matters:** Students with a standard lunch scored about **11 points higher** in Math than those on reduced lunch programs.
2. **Prep Works:** Completing a test preparation course boosted writing scores by nearly **10 points**.
3. **Reading & Writing Go Hand-in-Hand:** If a student is good at reading, there is a **95% chance** they are also excellent at writing.

## 🔍 Key Questions We Answered

### 1. Does a student's home life affect their grades?
**Yes.** We found that as the parents' education level increases, student scores tend to rise. We built a prediction tool that shows students with highly educated parents generally start with a stronger academic foundation.

### 2. Is there a "Gender Gap" in subjects?
We noticed a clear trend:
- **Boys** performed better on average in **Math**.
- **Girls** performed significantly better in **Reading and Writing**.

### 3. Does the "Test Prep" course actually work?
**Absolutely.** Students who finished the course saw an average improvement across all subjects. The biggest jump was in **Writing**, where prepared students scored significantly higher than those who did no extra prep.

### 4. How much does lunch type affect performance?
This was one of our most striking findings. Students who have access to a **Standard Lunch** (an indicator of better nutrition or higher socio-economic status) consistently outscored students on "Free/Reduced" lunch programs by significant margins in every single subject.

## 🛠️ How We Did It (The Simple Version)
We used professional data tools (Python) to act like digital detectives:
- **Visual Maps:** We created charts and graphs (Boxplots and Bar charts) to see patterns that are hard to spot in a spreadsheet.
- **The Prediction Model:** We used a method called "Linear Regression" to calculate exactly how many extra points a student might get based on their lunch type or their parents' degree.
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** This helped us see which subjects are "linked" together.
